Our app is a platform for University of Toronto students to connect
and communicate with other students in their courses or program.

How to use:
Launch the app using npm start and you will arrive at our signup page. From this page you will be able to 
login as an existing user or signup as a new user. If you want to login as 
an existing user, you can choose from signing in as our admin user or 
our regular user. To simplify things, we will show how to login as an admin
at the end. Here is how to login as a regular user.

Regular user:

username: user
password: password

If you want to signup as a new user, type in your desired
username and password and then click the signup button.
You will be brought to our signup page where you can choose a profile
picture and then input your program, year, and the courses in which 
you are currently enrolled. You will also have the option to list a 
couple of your hobbies as well as give yourself a brief bio.

After signing up as a new user or logging in as an existing user, you will be 
brought to the home page of our site. From here you can see a list of 
chats corresponding to the courses that you are currently enrolled in,
your current schedule for the day (based on the courses you are enrolled in),
a to-do list which you can add to and remove as you please, and a search bar to 
find other students. Lets go over each of these functionalities.

Chats: 

Clicking on a chat in the sidebar will open up a corresponding chat view
where you can send messages to that group/person.


Searchbar: Here you can type in a students name, or a particular course
or program to find other students having that same name, taking 
that same course, or enrolled in that same program.

Ex: Typing in CSC30, will show all students with courses containing 
the string CSC30 (CSC309, CSC300,...).

Add chat: Clicking on the chat button next to a student, will add a chat 
to the sidebar for the corresponding student.


From the home page we see two links on the navbar corresponding to the home page
and the profile settings page. We've already talked about the home page, so lets 
talk about the profile settings page.

profile settings page:

From the profile settings page, you have the option to change your profile picture,
add or remove courses from your currently enrolled courses, and update your bio.


Now let's talk about the admin functionality. To sign in as an admin, use the following
credentials:

Admin:

username: admin
password: admin

Once you are in the admin view, you will see a list of reported groups and students.
You can click on any group or student, to get a quick description of their offense.
You will also be presented with the option to ban the user/group or dismiss their
offense.

With both types of users, we provide the option to logout of your account
via a button in the top right corner.
